## Encryption Techniques: Caesar Cipher and Playfair Cipher

This project is an Android application developed in Java that implements two classic encryption techniques: Caesar Cipher and Playfair Cipher. The app takes two inputs, a plain text and a key, and displays the corresponding cipher text using the selected encryption method.

### Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plain text is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a key of 3, 'A' would be encrypted as 'D', 'B' as 'E', and so on. The same process is applied in reverse to decrypt the cipher text back into the original plain text.

### Playfair Cipher
Playfair Cipher is a more advanced encryption technique that uses a 5x5 matrix of letters. It operates on pairs of letters in the plain text and replaces them with other letters based on specific rules. The matrix is generated using a keyword, and the exact rules for encryption and decryption are defined by the positions of the letters in the matrix.

This project provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter their plain text and key, select the desired encryption technique (Caesar Cipher or Playfair Cipher), and instantly obtain the corresponding cipher text. The app showcases the implementation of both encryption methods and demonstrates their usage in a practical scenario.

Feel free to explore the source code and use it as a reference for learning about encryption techniques or integrating them into your own projects. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are highly appreciated!

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.
4. Enter the plain text and key in the provided input fields.
5. Select the encryption technique (Caesar Cipher or Playfair Cipher).
6. Click the "Encrypt" button to generate the cipher text.
7. The cipher text will be displayed on the screen.

Enjoy exploring encryption techniques and experimenting with different keys and texts!
